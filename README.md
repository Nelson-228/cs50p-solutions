# CS50P Solutions - My Software Engineering Journey

Welcome to my CS50P (Introduction to Programming with Python) solutions repository! This is where I document my learning journey as I study Software Engineering.

## 🎯 About This Repository

This repository contains my solutions and practice code from CS50P, Harvard's Introduction to Programming with Python course. Each file represents a step in my learning journey, with detailed comments explaining the concepts I'm learning.

## 📚 Learning Progress

### Day 1 - Basic Python Concepts
- **Functions**: Learning how to organize code into reusable blocks
- **Variables**: Understanding how to store and manipulate data
- **Input/Output**: Getting user input and displaying results
- **String Methods**: Working with text data

## 🚀 Programs

### 1. `hello.py` - Basic Input/Output
**What it does**: Asks for the user's name and greets them personally.

**Key Concepts Learned**:
- Function definition (`def main():`)
- Variables and data storage
- User input with `input()`
- F-strings for string formatting
- Basic program structure

**Example Usage**:
```
Enter your name: Nelson
Hello, Nelson
```

### 2. `playback.py` - String Manipulation
**What it does**: Takes user text and replaces spaces with three dots, creating a "playback" effect.

**Key Concepts Learned**:
- String methods (`.replace()`)
- Text processing
- Function organization
- Input validation and processing

**Example Usage**:
```
Enter your text: Hello world
Hello...world
```

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system
2. Navigate to this directory in your terminal
3. Run any program with: `py filename.py`

For example:
```bash
py hello.py
py playback.py
```

## 📝 Notes for Beginners

- Each file contains detailed comments explaining every line of code
- I'm learning these concepts step by step, so the code is intentionally simple and well-documented
- Feel free to use these as reference or learning materials!

## 🎓 Learning Goals

- [x] Understand basic Python syntax
- [x] Learn about functions and variables
- [x] Practice input/output operations
- [x] Work with string manipulation
- [ ] Continue with more advanced concepts...

## 📅 Study Log

**Day 1**: Started with basic Python concepts, created two simple programs to understand functions, variables, and string manipulation. Added comprehensive comments to understand every line of code.
